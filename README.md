👋 Hi, I’m @bhupen277
👀 I’m interested in DevOps, automation, and cloud technologies.

🌱 I’m currently learning tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, and AWS services.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DevOps projects, CI/CD pipeline implementations, and cloud-based solutions.

📫 You can reach me at   - www.linkedin.com/in/bhupendra-devops-engineer

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy solving complex problems and love experimenting with new DevOps tools in my spare time!
